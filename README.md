# RCNN-with-Attention-Mechanism
This is an experimentation in the domain of computer vision, where I dived deeper into the R-CNN and Faster R-CNN architectures and Vison Attention.

Problem Statement: To develop a classification model that can classify oral diseases present in a single image. This
 task focuses on image preprocessing and machine learning (ML) techniques, particularly
 deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model should predict
 a single disease class (e.g., healthy, dental caries, gingivitis, etc.) for each image. It must
 handle variations in image quality, lighting, and orientations to ensure high classification
 accuracy.
 Key Requirements
 1. Multiclass Classification:
 ○ Each image can belong to only one disease class.
 ○ The model must assign probabilities for each class (e.g., caries, gingivitis,
 etc.).
 2. Handling Variations:
 ○ Variations in lighting, angles, or quality of images should not affect
 performance.
 ○ The model should generalize across different age groups, genders, and
 demographics.

Architecture: A custom built R-CNN with spatial attention module
